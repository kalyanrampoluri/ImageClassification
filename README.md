# ImageClassification

**Facial Recognition using CNN in Colab**
This project implements a facial recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Colab. The model is trained on a dataset of faces and can classify the category of the face expression from 7 classes i.e. 'angry',  'disgust',  'fear',  'happy'  ,'neutral', 'sad’, ‘surprise'.

**Prerequisites**
To run this project, you will need:
A Google account to access Colab
A dataset from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samaneheslamifar/facial-emotion-expressions
Basic knowledge of Python and TensorFlow
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
Open the Facial_Recognition.ipynb file in Colab.
In username put:Kalyanpoluri and in key : fc53a7e1ac5b50b28d029509eec9ddf7 for downloading data directly from kaggle.
Run the remaining code cells to train the model and test it on validation faces.
**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project should be a collection of images of faces, with each image labelled with the corresponding person's name or ID. The images should be in JPEG or PNG format and all should be the same size.
**Training the Model**
The model is trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The training process is performed in Colab using a GPU for faster computation. The Facial_Recognition.ipynb file contains all the necessary code to train the model.

**Testing the Model**
To test the model, simply provide any image from validation data to the trained model and it will predict the category of the person’s expression in the image. The Facial_Recognition.ipynb file contains code to load the trained model and test it on new faces.

**CREDITS**
This project demonstrates how to implement a facial recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Colab. By following the steps outlined in this README file, you should be able to train and test your own facial recognition model.
